    "qualityControlText": "We employed technology when applicable to facilitate our workflows. To reduce personal bias and facilitate crowdsourcing, we adopted multiple interaction approaches. When editing and cross-checking entries, editors can leave comments in the column for internal reference. Editing histories are also preserved and made visible to all editors for record-keeping. In addition, public users can report issues on a form on our website or by email.\n\nTo ensure correctness in our published entries, all new entries are unpublished when created, and only a handful of senior editors have the rights to publish an entry. In practice the chief editor publishes the vast majority of entries. The chief editor is assisted by a review system where any editor can mark an entry as reviewed. This gives the chief editor an additional assurance vouching for the accuracy of the entry, and allows the system to prioritize entries that have already been reviewed by others for the chief editor's final review before publication.",

    "aboutWordshkTenetsText": "Words.hk is a descriptivist dictionary. Our goal is to document the actual contemporary state of the Cantonese language in Hong Kong, not to set an 'authoritative' standard. In addition to usage that is accepted by mainstream Cantonese users, we also document features that are used by a substantial minority.",

    "aboutWordshkPurposeText": "When we started the project, Cantonese dictionaries in Chinese included only words that are not Mandarin; whereas those in English focused on translating simple words and phrases. We believe that making a comprehensive, bilingual Cantonese dictionary would raise the status of Cantonese as a standalone and complete language, helping us pass on our heritage.",
