at him, Jia Jia quickly ran home again and told his father about it.", "Dad was very angry when he heard this, thinking that a monster had invaded the village!", "So he gathered the villagers, put away his equipment, and decided to go and drive a purple bird out of the village tonight.", "Seeing that the incident was so serious, Jia Jia began to carefully recall the whole thing, and gradually felt that something was wrong -", "In fact, a purple bird never hurt him from beginning to end, it was he who fell into the pond by mistake, and then the purple bird tried to save him, why would he be sure that he was a bad animal?", "At this moment, Jia Jia felt very regretful, and he decided to help a purple bird.", "So Jia Jia went around convincing these adults, and also asked a whole class of animal friends to help, hoping to prove that this purple bird was not malicious.", "With the joint efforts of Jia Jia and other animals, the villagers finally agreed to communicate with a purple bird.", "The purple bird said that all his friends called him Ah Zi.", "Listening to Ah Zi, it turns out that there are many birds of different colors in this world, and Ah Zi and they have a very important task, that is, to bring color to different corners of the world.", "Ah Zi said while patting his wing, and then a lot of petite things scattered with the wind.", "Zi said that his mission this time was to bring Zi to the village of Jiajia, and those petite things floating around were the seeds of raisins.", "When these seeds grow up, they will turn into a purple fruit, petite, round, bunches, very sweet and delicious.", "Ah Zi said that he and other colored birds are born with a natural coat color, just like humans, and will have a different skin color.", "No matter what color the other party is, the most important thing is to know whether what he is doing is right or not; you can't assume that the other party must be a bad animal just because the other party's color is different from your own... ...", "After this time, Jia Jia learned to face new acquaintances with love and an open heart, and will not misunderstand others like this time.", "Fortunately, Ah Zi didn't mind being misunderstood, and made good friends with Jia Jia!", "Before Zi left the village, he and Jia Jia spent a lot of happy time.", "In the near future, the forest of this village will have a
